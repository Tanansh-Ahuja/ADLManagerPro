# Trading Technologies TT.NET SDK
TT.NET SDK includes an Application Programming Interface (API) for the TT platform that provides developers the ability to create applications that communicate with the TT platform . Specifically, applications can subscribe for prices, route orders, and receive fills.


TT.NET SDK is based on Microsoft .NET technology. And it's interface was designed to duplicate the interface of the X_TRADER platform's TT API to minimize migration efforts. TT.NET SDK also provides:

	- Improved performance and scalability
	- Integration with Microsoft Visual Studio, including Intellisense and built-in documentation
	- Support for multi-threaded application development

It also provides a single, normalized interface for interacting with all exchanges supported by Trading Technologies.
